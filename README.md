# üîä VoiceChat Discord Bot

> VoiceChatBot is a Discord bot made with the sole purpose of managing Voice Channels.

## üìÉ About
Too many channels in your community for your members to join? VoiceChatBot eliminates countless unused voice channels and generates voice channels for your community when it is needed.

When you setup your bot for the first time, your community can join a permanent voice channel that allows them to generate a new voice channel, this then allows them to manage it using various commands. The voice channel will be automatically deleted once all members have left said channel.

This bot was originally a forked project from: [@Mattizhu](https://github.com/mattizhu/voicechatbot)

## üîê Bot Permissions
The Discord bot requires certain global permissions in your server to be able to work properly:

- View Channels
- Manage Channels
- Manage Roles
- Create Invites
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Add Reactions
- Mention Roles
- Manage Messages
- Read Message History
- Connect
- Move Members

This bot also accepts Discord ID's as well as @Mentions when calling certain commands; To take full advantage of this feature of the bot, please enable `PRESENCE INTENT` and `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`. This will allow the bot to collect Cache for guild members.
